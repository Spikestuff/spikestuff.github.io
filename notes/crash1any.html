	<p>Crash Bandicoot has 6 bosses, two of them are just "jump on the boss/thing" but to at least go through them...</p>

    </div>

    <div id="min" class="active"></div>

    <div id="boss-1" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Papu Papu</h2>
        <p>In the Japanese version you have to jump on Papu Papu 5 times, compared to the US release of 3.
        <br><br>
        You are able to immediately jump on Papu when he slams his staff down.
        <br>
        You need to wait for him to stop flashing to be able to jump on him again,
        <br>
        this is just before Papu Papu completes a full revolution.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="boss-2" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Ripper Roo</h2>
        <p>
        Ripper Roo has 3 health bars, and he moves in three separate patterns.
        <br>
        You start with two masks in this fight.
        <br>
        <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr>
            <th>Phase 1</th>
            <th>Phase 2</th>
            <th>Phase 3</th>
        </tr>
        <tr style="font-size: 150%;">

            </td>
            <td>

            </td>
            <td>
                ⬜⬜⬜<br>
                ⬜⬛⬜<br>
                ⬛⬜⬛
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="3">
            (dark squares is Ripper Roo's movement)
            </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        To start this fight let the first Big TNT blow up naturally.
        <br>
        <br>
        When Ripper Roo's invisibility ends, spin the TNT sitting next to him.
        <br>
        Repeat on the final hit as well to get out early.
        <br><br>
        If you're unable to do that, just know that it takes three platforms of movement before he can be damaged by the Big TNT you jumped on. So plan your attacks ahead.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="boss-3" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Koala Kong</h2>
        <p>
        Koala Kong takes 4 hits of damage.
        <br><br>
        You need to spin the three rocks that he throws at you,
        <br>
        whilst avoiding the TNT that's falling above you.
        <br><br>
        After the third rock is thrown he will carry to the center a larger rock.
        <br>
        This is the one you can spin back with,
        <br>
        but try to avoid hitting the minecarts when sending a rock back at Koala Kong.
        <br><br>
        On the first two the TNT will land only on the Left Side.
        <br><br>
        At the third and fourth phases there will be two that will fall,
        <br>
        one on the left then the center just before the TNT blows up where your safety is on the right,
        <br>
        a final one will fall from the center after the previous two explode.
        <br><br>
        This is where it's recommended to use the TNT Jumping to clear any spacing if you do have difficulty with this boss.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="boss-4" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Pinstripe Potoroo</h2>
        <p>
        A relatively simple boss to deal with that has 6 health bars.
        <br><br>
        Wait for Pinstripe to complete his first round of firing then immediately go on the offensive,
        <br>
        you'll be able to attack him three times.
        <br>
        Go behind cover behind the chair and wait for his gun to jam to attack him again.
        <br><br>
        Pinstripe's movement is going from one side to the other then his gun will jam,
        <br>
        so just be covered on the opposite side to where he starts shooting.
        <br>
        On his last health he'll jam when he is in the center (one movement), so be ready to go at him.
        <br><br>
        What more experienced runners do is allow him to be on the right side first before dealing 3 damage on him,
        <br>
        as the fourth bit of damage will be immediate when he crosses back to the left side,
        <br>
        reducing the time spent dealing with the boss.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="boss-5" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Dr. Nitrus Brio</h2>
        <p>
        N. Brio has 9 health.
        <br><br>
        The first half of his fight is avoiding the red beakers that he throws at you<br>
        and Jump Spin on the green blobs that manifest from the green beakers.
        <br><br>
        When N. Brio is down to 3 health, he will throw six red beakers and turn into the Hulk.
        <br>
        When he's charging at you jump on the rubble that fell from above, then jump on Brio.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="boss-6" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Dr. Neo Cortex</h2>
        <p>
        Cortex has 5 health, and is the final boss of the game.
        <br><br>
        You are looking for a green energy that you will be able to return to sender.
        <br>
        He also shoots out Pink ones at you and Blue ones that enter in from the side.
        <br><br>
        With the blue ones these are telegraphed where their height will be starting from and which height they'll be.
        <br>
        Mid-way through the third phase they will move diagonally, meaning it'll start off at the opposite of the starting height.
        <br><br>
        This is a real simple boss to learn and do, and I am kind of overcomplicating it a bit,
        <br>
        but this is just in case you haven't really played or remembered much about Crash Bandicoot.
        <br><br>
        And to help about it.
        <br>
        Even though this information isn't really necessary this is what he shoots in order of phases:
        <br><br>
        <b>Phase 1:</b> Two Pinks, One Green.<br>
        <b>Phase 2:</b> Pink, Blue (bot), Pink, Blue (bot), Blue (bot), 2 Greens.<br>
        <b>Phase 3:</b> Pink, Blue (bot), Blue (top), Pink, Green, Pink, Blue (bot), Blue (bot), Blue (top), 2 Greens.<br>
        <b>Phase 4:</b> 5 Pink (rapid), Green, 5 Pink (rapid), Green.<br>
        <b>Phase 5:</b> Green.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
	<b>And that’s time.</b>
	<br><br>
	If you want to be goofy and if you learn the timing,
	<br>
	you can jump off after Cortex and be rewarded with the credits or if you time it badly you have to fight Cortex again...
	<br>
	So don’t do what I did when I ran this game decades ago.
	<br><br>
	We’re now just going to be entering some Intermediate stuff that’s good to learn early.

	<a href="#wall-clipping">
		<h2 id="wall-clipping">Wall Clipping</h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		This is an essential trick that exists in the Lost City and Sunset Vista.
		<br><br>
		Both are the same trick, but are executed at different points.
		<br><br>
		This trick saves a lot of time as you avoid all obstacles at the cost of falling in the water and going back to the checkpoint.
	</p>
	
	<br>

	<a href="#death-abuse">
		<h2 id="death-abuse">Death Abusing</h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		So you're taking the head first approach to Crash Bandicoot any% and choosing to run the NTSC-U version.
		<br><br>
		Almost every level has a death abuse point so it's extremely important to keep your lives above zero at all times.<br>
		This is to prepare for a Game Over abuse midway through the run.
		<br><br>
		You do not death abuse in <b>Hog Wild</b> where you want to miss at least one box and <b>The Lost City</b> where you have to get the Green Gem
	</p>

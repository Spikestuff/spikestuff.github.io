		<h1> The Endless Void That is Myst any% <br>
			<sup style="font-size: 50%;">(Are we already talking about this?)</sup></h1>
		<p>
			So this nightmare title that's a 2 minute speedrun has a few differences.
			<br>
			You'd only know if you dedicated your time to it like <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/users/Lizstar"><b>Lizstar</b></a> has... or <a href="https://tasvideos.org/GameGroups/235"><b>myself</b></a>.
			<br><br>
			So surely that means there are notable differences, and you'd be correct,
			<br>
			so we're going to do a "quick" rundown of this.
		</p>

	<br>

		<a href="#macos-release">
			<h2 id="macos-release"> The Original Mac OS Release </h2>
		</a>
		<p>
		So Myst was a title that was released on the MacOS in September 1993 and this is where the differences immediately start.
		<br>
		The MacOS version has an error, where in the final fireplace code there are two input sequences you can place in it, the correct one, and Page 148.

		This was discovered by a Reverse Engineer known as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlbarbi"><b>Jeff Barbi</b></a> who showcased this oversight at <a href="https://youtu.be/lacwEuMaQvQ?t=2226"><b>Mysterium 2024</b></a> (37:06),
		<br>
		but other than that compared to a modern release this is basically identical.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<a href="#mohawk-engine">
			<h2 id="mohawk-engine"> Enter the Mohawk Engine </h2>
	</a>
		<h3>Windows & Commodore Amiga</h3>
		<p>
		As of the release of the Windows 3.1 version a year later Cyan changed engines to Mohawk,
		<br>
		this release would basically be the ground works of many versions, and to knock out the ones that have no differences.
		<br><br>
		Well we're skipping the Windows 3.1 release, nothing changes except for the Page 148 oversight being removed.
		<br>
		Whilst here we're going to be skipping the Commodore Amiga version as well.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>3DO, Sega Saturn and iPhone/Android</h3>
		<p>
		Meaning we're at the next release for the 3DO machine.
		<br>
		This version doesn't have zipping at all... so there's nothing else to talk about here.
		<br>
		Other "zipless" versions are the Sega Saturn and iPhone/Android releases.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Jaguar CD</h3>
		<p>
		Funnily enough the Jaguar CD version has a grand total of one zip in the any% speedrun,
		<br>
		and that's found between the Library and the Docks.
		<br><br>
		This is the only zip.
		<br>
		You have to walk everywhere else with this chonky controller.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Sony PlayStation</h3>
		<p>
		Now we've made it to the whiplash version.
		<br>
		PlayStation. "Zip Mode" is horrendously broken.
		<br><br>
		Once you enable that "Zip Mode", you're able to click almost anywhere and just be elsewhere.
		<br>
		You can go from the starting position to the Sunken Gear in one click,
		<br>
		compared to the actual traversal of five clicks.
		<br><br>
		You can practically instantly transmission anywhere and everywhere.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>CD-i</h3>
		<p>
		And now we're at the CD-i version. We have two zips that no longer exist.
		<br><br>
		That's the movement from the Clock Tower to the crossroad towards the Generator and Log Cabin
		<br>
		and the movement from the Library to the Docks.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Nintendo DS</h3>
		<p>
		Nintendo DS is going to be mentioned here, it may be identical to the Windows release,
		<br>
		but besides the major difference of it being touch controls and not having a visible cursor at all, you're going by touch.
		<br>
		You need to know where you're touching once you enable "Zip Mode".
		<br><br>
		The interesting part which should be brought up is in the "all pages" category.
		<br>
		Due to an oversight in the code, we're able to jump around the Ages much like the PlayStation version... after you exit a different Age.
		<br>
		Selenitic is the first age you should be entering which will open the entire game.
		<br><br>
		At the cost of doing the worst puzzle.
		</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>PlayStation Portable</h3>
		<p>
		Now the PlayStation Portable version may be a nothing burger in terms of changes,
		<br>
		it does have an interesting choice made by the Myst community that needs to be brought up.
		<br><br>
		The community allows the back ups of the UMD releases to get into the game sooner thanks for the use of the Japanese version.
		<br>
		As well as allowing the use of the Vita with Adrenaline. Making it the best way to play for this handheld.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<a href="#flash-release">
			<h2 id="flash-release"> The Flash Release </h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		So if you owned a PocketPC you had a chance to get Myst on it, and Riven.
		<br>
		There's unfortunately no documented information about this version in the speedrunning scene.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<a href="#flash-release">
			<h2 id="flash-release"> ScummVM (but we're still the Mohawk Engine) </h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		Now we can just refer to the original comments about the Windows release, but it's real important to mention here.
		<br>
		The ScummVM version of Myst allows you to "skip" sequences thanks to the Escape key, or whatever you rebind it to.
		<br><br>
		In Myst there's "PC" and "SVM-Free".
		<br>
		To keep it short, PC is the official current release on Good old Games (GoG) and Steam.
		<br>
		Available for Windows and Mac. This is a special ScummVM build of Myst: Masterpiece Edition which is to be used.
		<br><br>
		"SVM-Free" is whatever version of ScummVM that you want to use,
		<br>
		from the aforementioned GoG and Stream release or your own Physical CD or DVD release of the title.
		<br>
		This category is also for the Linux runners out there.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	
	<a href="#myst3DS">
			<h2 id="myst3DS"> Myst on the Nintendo 3DS </h2>
	</a>
	<p>
		This is a bit of a different version, this is realMyst released for the Nintendo 3DS.
		<br><br>
		It follows the newer graphical artstyle that came out for its time,
		<br>
		but the movement is still that of point-and-click, no free exploration unlike actual versions of realMyst.
		<br><br>
		This is also the worst version of Myst. This isn't up for a debate.
		<br>
		You do not have touch support like the DS release of the title, instead you have to use the top screen,
		<br>
		whilst fighting the 3DS' analog stick due to the extreme sensitivity of the cursor.
		<br><br>
		All zips are retained in this version.
		<br><br>
		Anyways, that's it.
		<br>
		I may be adding photos/video to show the zip points in the future.
		<br>
		I won't be covering the 3D versions, at least for now,
		<br>
		But there are slight differences that can still be covered.

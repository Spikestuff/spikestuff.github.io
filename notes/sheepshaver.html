		<p>
			There was probably information on this sort of thing,
			<br>
			but for me it's running into the issue head first.

			Starting off we actually need the program SheepShaver which is on; 
			<a href="https://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5325"><b>Windows</b></a>, 
			<a href="https://github.com/Korkman/macemu-appimage-builder/releases/latest"><b>Linux</b></a> and
			<a href="https://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7360"><b>Mac OS X</b></a>.
			<br><br>
			For the build of Mac OS we're going to be using Mac OS 8.5.
			<br>
			OS 9 might also work as well, but I'm just showing what I know.
			<br><br>
			For the ROM File we're going to be using a <i>Power Mac 6500</i>.
			<br>
			We also want our game in the <i>.toast</i> format, this is the format it wants to have. We're using <i>Myst</i>.
			<br><br>
			What you thought I was actually going to provide that stuff? No.

		</a>
		<p>
			We're going to be using the SheepShaverGUI setup for this, otherwise I would want to void out.
			<br><br>
			<b>Within Volumes</b>
			<br>
			<i>Add</i> both the Mac OS 8.5 iso and the game you wish to install (in my case it's Myst.toast).
			<br>
			<i>Create</i> and name the Volume File (I have mine set to 256MiB, as Mac OS requires 157MiB).
			<br><br>
			<b>Within Graphics / Sound</b>
			<br>
			Set the Windows Refresh Rate to 60 Hz and the Width / Height to whatever you want (in this case I'm using 640x480).
			<br>
			You can adjust the Render Driver away from Software, but for my sake I'm leaving it on Software.
			<br><br>
			<b>Within Memory / Misc</b>
			<br>
			Set the MacOS Ram Size (MB) to whatever you want, I'm using 256MB.
			<br>
			Point the ROM file, to the-- ROM File that you're going to be using (in our case it's the <i>Power Mac 6500</i> mentioned earlier).
			<br><br>
			Select <i>Start</i>.

		</a>
		<p>
			Follow the initialization process.
			<br>
			Afterwards select <i>Mac OS Install</i> from the Mac OS disk and follow its process.
			<br>
			After installation select <i>Special</i> and <i>Shut Down</i>.
			<br>
			You can now <i>remove</i> the Mac OS 8.5 iso within SheepShaverGUI, since we don't need to install a new instance.
			<br><br>
			You can now launch without the GUI executable, and now you can follow the <i>installation</i> process for the game you want to play.
			<br>
			Congratulations, you can now play your game-- <i>Myst</i>.
